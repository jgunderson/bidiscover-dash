# angular-dashboard-framework

> Dashboard framework with Angular.js, Twitter Bootstrap and Font Awesome.

The api of angular-dashboard-framework (adf) is documented [here](http://sdorra.github.io/angular-dashboard-framework/docs/).

## Demo

A live demo of the adf can be viewed [here](http://sdorra.github.io/angular-dashboard-framework/). The demo uses html5 localStorage to store the state of the dashboard. The source of the demo can be found [here](https://github.com/sdorra/angular-dashboard-framework/tree/master/sample).

A more dynamic example can be found [here](https://github.com/sdorra/adf-dynamic-example).

## Getting started

Install bower and grunt:

```bash
npm install -g bower
npm install -g grunt-cli
```

Clone the repository:

```bash

cd angular-dashboard-framework
```

Install npm and bower dependencies:

You can start the sample dashboard, by using the server grunt task:
